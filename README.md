Heart-Rate-Monitoring-System using Proteus 8.9
Heart rate simply indicates the soundness of our heart. It helps
assessing the condition of cardiovascular system. On the other
hand body temperature is also a general indication of body
condition. Heartbeat and body temperature are the major sign
that are routinely checked by doctors after the arrival of a
patient. Heart related diseases are increasing day by day.
According to WHO, 17 million people of the world die from
CVD (Cardiovascular Disease) which makes up to 31% of the
deaths worldwide. On the other hand, temperature monitoring
is very important in this pandemic situation. We all know the
first symptoms of COVID-19 in most of the people is Fever.
So regular body temperature measuring is not only important
but also a necessary step for being careful now a days.
Therefore, an accurate, affordable heartrate and body
temperature measuring device is essential for taking actions in
proper time. Thatâ€™s why we choose this topic by considering
the mentioned situations. Such a device is more essential in a
situation when there is no clinic or doctor nearby (rural area)
and patients are unable to recognize their actual condition. By
using this any people can easily recognize their condition and if
there is any abnormality found, they can contact with doctors
in the earliest possible time and the can same themselves from
any uncertain risks. For better treatment, there is no alternative
of detecting the diseases timely.
